# recursiveCountHi

Return the number of times that the string "hi" appears anywhere in the given string.

Solution must be recursive. (no while or for loops)

Examples:
recursiveCountHi('abc hi ho') → 1
recursiveCountHi('ABChi hi') → 2
recursiveCountHi('hihi') → 2

Notes:
* We are only interested in lowercase "hi"s

/**
 * Count how many "hi"s there are in a string recursively
 * @param {string} str A string of charters
 * @return {number} The total number of "hi"s in the string
